1. when we use 'MySql.Data.EntityFrameworkCore' framework or 'Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql' framework, you will meet an error saying '`value conversion not supported`'. By now, the solved method is to use 'Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql(2.1.0-rc1-final)' instead to support value conversion.

2. We have two schemes to save the 'IntegrationEventLog'. One is to save it in the same database with movies. The other is to create a new database. As the EventLog and the movies have to change simultaneously, we use transaction to ensure synchronization. However, EF core 2.1 doesn't support distributed transaction. We have to use the first scheme. In the first scheme, we need to intialize two tables in one database through '`DBContext.Database.EnsureCreated()`' or '`Migratecontext`'. For database migration is complex in docker, we choose to use '`DBContext.Database.EnsureCreated()`'. Here is the dilemma, we can't initializw two tables when ensuring onedatabase created. In other words, no matter how many times executing '`DBContext.Database.EnsureCreated()`', the aiming Object is the database instead of the tables. We can only initialize tables corresponding to the first context. **By now, we are in a dilemma and can't solved one problem, so this part is to be continued.(see [here]() for details)**
