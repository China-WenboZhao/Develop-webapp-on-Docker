As mentioned in [https://github.com/China-WenboZhao/Develop-webapp-on-Docker/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/China-WenboZhao/Develop-webapp-on-Docker/blob/master/README.md), you will meet an error saying 'value conversion not supported' no matter using 
'MySql.Data.EntityFrameworkCore' framework or 'Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql'. because current version MySQL provider version not support 'value conversion'. There is no good method to fix by now instead of using SqlServer.
