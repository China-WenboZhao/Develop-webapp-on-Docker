In this solution, we add Authentication, **but here is one more problem remained:**  
In [WebMVC/Startup.cs](https://github.com/China-WenboZhao/Develop-webapp-on-Docker/blob/master/MovieWebsite(v2.0)/WebMVC/Startup.cs), you can see 'options.Authority=...'. Here we set the IdentityServer path, but this path is used both for redirect and containers communications. If we want to remain redirect. the path should be http://localhost:5001/. In converse, If we want to remain cotainers communication, the path should be http://identityservice:5001/. By now, we use second  path, so we need to change the url manually from identityserver:5001/connect/authorize?... to localhost:5001/connect/authorize?... .
