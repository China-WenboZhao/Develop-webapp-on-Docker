1. If you are careful enough, you will find that in the former solutions we use 'Mysql.Data.EntityFrameworkCore' framework(with EF core 2.0/2.1)  in all microservices.  
In this solution, we keep using 'Mysql.Data.EntityFrameworkCore' framework(with EF core 2.0/2.1) in IdentityServer but using 'Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql' framework in MoviesService. The '`options.UseMySQL`' method also changed to '`options.UseMySql`'(see [here](https://github.com/China-WenboZhao/Develop-webapp-on-Docker/blob/master/MovieWebsite(v4.0)/MoviesService/Startup.cs) too view codes). Why this happens?  
We are not quite sure which snippet trigger a bug of `'Mysql.Data.EntityFrameworkCore' framework but it does after doing Dependency Injection of EventBus, you will see error like this 'Method not found: 'Void Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Storage.Internal.RelationalCommandBuilderFactory..ctor(Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Diagnostics.IDiagnosticsLogger 1<Command>, Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Storage.IRelationalTypeMapper)'.'` According to general reflection, this is a Oracle's bug. See [https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/11078](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/11078) for details.
  (When you see this, the bug may has been fixed.)
